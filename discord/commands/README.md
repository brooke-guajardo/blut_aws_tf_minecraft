## Purpose
- To use slash commands, they need to be registered as per Discord Api documentation
    - https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#registering-a-command 
- The python script in this directory simply needs the values in the list commands_to_register to match the commands used in lambda_function.py
